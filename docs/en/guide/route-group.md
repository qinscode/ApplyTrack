# Route Group

Reference [Next.js Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups)

In the `pages` directory, we can use `(folderName)` to implement route groups.

This is often used for:
- Organizing routes into groups, such as by page purpose, type, etc.
- Sharing layouts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the `pages` directory, the files under `(folderName)` directory will be considered as route groups

## Layout

Route group layout can be placed in `(folderName)/layout.tsx`

```tsx
// src/pages/(admin)/layout.tsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom"

export function Component() {
  return (
    <section>
      {/* Layout content */}
      <nav></nav>
      <Outlet />
    </section>
  )
}
```
