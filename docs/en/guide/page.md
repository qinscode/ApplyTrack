# Page

By default, you can create pages from the `src/pages` directory.

For example, to create a page named `index`, you can create a `src/pages/index.tsx` file and add the following content:

```tsx
// src/pages/index.tsx
export  function Component() {
  return <div>Home Page</div>;
}
```

Then, to create more pages, just create more files in the `src/pages` directory. For example, to create a page for the `about` route, you can create a `src/pages/about.tsx` file and add the following content:

```tsx
// src/pages/about.tsx
export  function Component() {
  return <div>About Page</div>;
}
```

> [!TIP]
> 1. The page component must be exported as a `Component` function to be rendered as a page
